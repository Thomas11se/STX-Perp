## üìÑ Overview

**STX-Perp** is a smart contract for trading **options** and **perpetuals (perps)** on the Stacks blockchain using STX tokens. The contract enables the creation, purchase, and exercise of options contracts and sets up foundational logic and data structures for perpetual futures.

> üîê This contract is written in **Clarity**, the smart contract language for Stacks, and is designed to be modular and easily extendable.
